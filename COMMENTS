General:
    Make sure to keep proper encapsulation.
    Make sure to have proper error handling
    There might be a lot of redundant or nonsensical code, should improve with time
    Add comments

Database:
    Make sure we can run the database from different computers in a straightforward manner

Models:
    Might be wise to refactor patient code to use DAO
    Patient:
        To be debated if it makes sense to have these in the patient object or not.
        We do need it in the database, but address for example could just be a different table with patient id as a foreign key

        Add attributes like:
            CitizenShip Card number
            National Health id/number
            Address
            Profession

Routes:
    Expand patient routes beyond CRUD
    Have an easier way to do exception management, have some kind of handler functions for exceptions if that makes sense

Testing:
    Have some kind of automated testing.
    Maybe do the test before development of that functionality starts

Next steps:
    Add doctor, appointments routes
    Add patient records
    Refactor doctor and appointment routes with patient record support, or just do that directly

Na rota update deveria ser possivel s√≥ atualizar os campos que queremos em vez de todos
